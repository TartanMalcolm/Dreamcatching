Scheme Name: Driver Assignment Scheme
OVERALL INTENT:

The Driver Assignment Scheme aims to link truck drivers to specific plans, ensuring that each plan's execution is attributed to a designated driver. This scheme helps to manage and track who is responsible for carrying out each routing plan, enhancing accountability and operational clarity within the CRM system.

MUSTs:

Be a valid, internally consistent JSON.
Include fields for a unique driver assignment identifier (assignmentId), the identifier of the driver (driverId), the plan identifier (planId), the truck identifier (truckId), and the date the plan is executed (executionDate).
Ensure that each driver assignment is linked to a specific plan from the previously defined planScheme, and a driver, ensuring clear responsibility for the execution of plans.
SHOULDs:

Provide clear descriptions for each field to ensure ease of understanding and correct use of the scheme.
Be easily integrable with other related schemes, like planScheme, to allow seamless operations without requiring redundant data entries.
COULDs:

Include additional attributes related to the driverâ€™s performance or feedback on the execution of the plan, which could be used for performance reviews or improvement initiatives.
Prepare for expansion to include real-time tracking elements or driver logs, which could provide more detailed insights into the execution of plans and driver activities.
MUST NOTs:

Omit critical linking fields such as driverId or planId, which are essential for the operational use of this scheme and understanding the responsibilities.
