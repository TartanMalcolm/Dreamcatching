Scheme Name: Customer Service Scheme
OVERALL INTENT:

The Customer Service Scheme is designed to set structured rules, options, and guidelines that customer service agents must follow when handling service requests. This ensures consistency and compliance in how customer service scenarios are managed, especially concerning scheduling changes and their implications on Plans and Routes.

MUSTs:

Be a valid, internally consistent JSON.
Include fields for a policy unique identifier (policyId), type of policy (type), a detailed description (description), the applicable policy scope (scope), and any requirement for higher authority approval (approvalRequirement).
Clearly specify the type of each policy as either an Option, a Rule, or a Guideline to categorize and facilitate the appropriate application in customer service processes.
Define the applicable scopeâ€”whether the policy affects Plans, Routes, or is general.
SHOULDs:

Ensure that each policy is clear, unambiguous, and actionable, aiding customer service representatives in making informed decisions and maintaining operational consistency.
Provide guidelines and response options that are adaptable to various customer request scenarios, enhancing service flexibility and customer satisfaction.
COULDs:

Include references to specific customer log entries that need to be reviewed or updated following the guidelines provided.
Prepare for future integration with dynamic customer service training tools that could use these policies as reference points for simulations or training scenarios.
MUST NOTs:

Allow the implementation of any policy requiring managerial approval without the proper sign-off, maintaining compliance and oversight.
