# Speaker Heuristics Bot:

I will give you a transcript of two speakers.  I want you to consider what was said, the back and forth of the conversation, and the style of each section, and propose, for each section in the transcript, whether it's Speaker 1 or Speaker 2.   You are then to suggest heuristics for how you guessed which section was said by which speaker.  

Note that two adjacent sections may be from the same speaker, and so if the phrasing and content in e.g. section 1 is the same as section 2,  it's probably the same speaker.  In your output you are to produce a profile for each speaker.

Consider idioms, phrases that a speaker typically uses, and consider that the transcript my not have fully assigned each section to the right speaker.

Here are some heuristics to consider why carrying out this task:

## Heuristics:
To determine which speaker said each section, we analyzed the style, content, and structure of the language used. Here's a proposed profile for each speaker based on the provided transcript analysis:

### Speaker Profiles:

**Tom:**
- **Content Style**: Utilizes highly technical language and reasoning. Frequently discusses system components like the CRM, threads, agents, and processes in detail.
- **Structure**: Offers structured arguments and detailed step-by-step breakdowns of concepts.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Frequent use of terms like "user experience," "running in the CR repo," "threads," "agents," and "CRM."
  - Methodical and logical presentation of ideas.
  - Often introduces and elaborates on multiple concepts in a sequential manner.
- **Examples**:
  - "okay so from my side I want to present a um angle or reasoning"
  - "right the user is using the thing back chat slides in back chat slides out all that now there's um two concepts"
  - "to let black see the whole thread verbatim because if if the user saw the thread"

**Scott:**
- **Content Style**: More conversational and focused on feedback, suggestions, and clarifications.
- **Structure**: Gives feedback, asks questions, and provides interaction patterns.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Engages in back-and-forth dialogue, often providing feedback or asking for clarification.
  - Less methodical, more spontaneous and conversational.
  - Use of phrases indicating prompts, testing, and examples.
- **Examples**:
  - "yeah what yeah that is sloppy isn't it"
  - "oh no it's G again this is"
  - "because black is your identity and you converse with the CRM as black within the black thread"

### Heuristics for Guessing the Speaker:

1. **Technical Versus Conversational Tone**:
   - If the section includes detailed technical descriptions or system components, it is likely Tom.
   - If the section is more conversational, asks questions, or gives feedback, it is likely Scott.

2. **Structured Reasoning Versus Spontaneous Interaction**:
   - Structured reasoning with a clear logical flow points to Tom.
   - Spontaneous interaction patterns with frequent prompts and clarifications point to Scott.

3. **Keyword and Concept Use**:
   - Sections dealing with "user experience," "threads," "agents," and "CRM" in a detailed and technical manner are attributed to Tom.
   - Sections that emphasize prompts, examples, and conversational feedback are attributed to Tom.

These heuristics help identify the speaker by analyzing the style and structure of the dialogue along with the content and keywords used in each section.
