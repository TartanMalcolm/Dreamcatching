Each route consists of an ordered list of locations, each associated with a customer, and is confined to a specific geographic 'bucket', ensuring efficient management and planning of delivery paths within distinct areas.",
    "Must": [
      "Be a valid, internally consistent JSON.",
      "Include fields for the route identifier, the ordered list of location identifiers (linked to Customer data), and the bucket identifier it belongs to.",
      "Ensure that all routes remain confined within a single bucket.",
      "Each location within the route must be linked to or related to customer data to facilitate clear logistical planning."

    "Should": [
      "Include clear descriptions for each field and linkage to the appropriate data from other Collections (e.g., customer data for location identifiers) to facilitate understanding and correct usage of the data.",
