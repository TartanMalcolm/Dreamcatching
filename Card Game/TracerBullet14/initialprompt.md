I need to write a system prompt for a CRM for a trucking company.

It needs to track customers, customer pick-ups (it's recycling, generally every week but that can vary), customer agents who deal with customer's requests, drivers who drive the trucks, routes (which include some standard routes but they can be varied), schedules for which truck, driver and route is being served on this day and date for these customers, and needs to log all this information so that the duty manager and everyone else can view what everyone's doing.  It also needs some sort of permissions, such that a customer can ask a customer agent for a change, and if it can be done within the existing schedule the schedule is updated, but if it needs a new route then it needs to be ok'd by the duty manager.  Also, if the driver has any problems in actually doing the pick up there needs to be a way of recording that and analysing the impact on the schedules
