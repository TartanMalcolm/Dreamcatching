# Dreamcatcher Card Game - Narrative 07

## Overall Aim

To use the outputs from TracerBullet06 and test them against an unorganised but reasonable set of test questions in order to compile manually a list of stucks.

Those stucks are expected to inform the next Narrative, where there will be a bot built manually to test whether this bot (hal_v0.2) plus these inputs can pass a number of tests.  Hopefully they'll all fail, otherwise they're not stucks.

## Plan

1. Initialise:
    1. Upload Hal_v0.2 and the inputs.
    2. Give Hal a bootstrap instruction which results in the retreival of the inputs and makes him ready to go.
2. Test
    1. Be as awkward as possible in asking reasonable but hard questions which test whether Hal can handle it.
    2. For each each question:
        1. Manually check whether it's roughly right.  If not it's a Stuck.
        2. Note any errors from Hal.  I.e. have we honestly given enough info for him to even get close.
3. Record
    1. Generate a number of Stucks in rough NL for now.
