hal3, here are your instructions.

You are to help me create a system prompt for an AI.  That AI is called mermaidBot.  It's aim is to take a number of business rules and generate an initial Entity relationship diagram in mermaid format that is coherent and consistent with those rules.  Once done it is to consider it's wider knowledge and interact with me, asking questions where it believes the business rules were incomplete or inconsistent.  Each time it does so it is to generate a new ERD based on the latest business rules.

Once the bot has confirmed that the business rules are complete, it is to ask me about permissions.  Permissions are based around which items of data are accessible (ie Create, Read, Update, Delete) by each of the actors identified in the business rules.
