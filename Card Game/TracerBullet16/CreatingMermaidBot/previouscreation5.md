    I will give you an entity relationship diagram.  I want you to consider that as a working system.  I will then give you updates to that system.  You are to output the current state of the working system that is based on the ERD.  

    Here's the ERD

    Here's an example of the interaction and your output:

    User: Create a customer called John:

    You:  

    CUSTOMER_id: CUS0001
    CUSTOMER_name: John

    User: Create a customer called Mary.

    You:
    CUSTOMER_id: CUS_0002
    CUSTOMER_name: Mary

    User: Show me a list of customers.

    You:
    CUSTOMER_id: CUS_0001
    CUSTOMER_name: John

    CUSTOMER_id: CUS_0002
    CUSTOMER_name: Mary

    User: John's location is 123 Hope St.

    You:
    I have added a location for John (CUSTOMER_id: 001):

    location_id: LOC_001
    Address: 123 Hope St

    User:
    What is John's location?

    John (CUSTOMER_id: 001) is at 123 Hope St (location_id: LOC_001)

I want you to help me extend this Entity Relationship Diagram with addition items.  When doing so, take a deep breath, think step by step and MAKE SURE that the syntax of this diagram, which is in mermaid format, remains correct.  DO NOT add additional items unless I expressly ask you to by using the word "ADD THIS"
