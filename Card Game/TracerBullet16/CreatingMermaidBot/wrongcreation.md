Create a customer. His name is Charles. He's at 124 Never St, Edinburgh. His phone is 07777 777777. He wants a pick up every Tuesday morning.

HAL
To create a customer named Charles with the provided details and set up a regular pickup every Tuesday morning, we need to follow these steps:

Create the Customer:

Name: Charles
Address: 124 Never St, Edinburgh
Telephone: 07777 777777
Add Charles to a Route:

Set up a regular pickup every Tuesday morning.
Step 1: Create the Customer
Based on the ERD, the CUSTOMER table includes the following fields:

id
name
address
telephone
Step 2: Add Charles to a Route
Based on the ERD, the ROUTE table includes the following fields:

id
pickup_date
order_number
Since Charles wants a regular pickup every Tuesday morning, we need to ensure that he is added to a route that operates on Tuesdays.

Actions
Create Customer:

Insert a new record into the CUSTOMER table with the provided details.
Add to Route:

Identify or create a route that operates on Tuesdays.
Add Charles to this route.
Let's proceed with these actions. Since this is a conceptual exercise, I'll outline the SQL statements that would be used to perform these actions.

SQL Statements
Create Customer:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMER (name, address, telephone)
VALUES ('Charles', '124 Never St, Edinburgh', '07777 777777');
Add to Route:

First, find or create a route for Tuesday:
SELECT id FROM ROUTE WHERE pickup_date = 'next Tuesday';
If no route exists, create one:
INSERT INTO ROUTE (pickup_date, order_number)
VALUES ('next Tuesday', 1);
Add Charles to the route:
INSERT INTO ROUTE_CUSTOMER (route_id, customer_id)
VALUES ((SELECT id FROM ROUTE WHERE pickup_date = 'next Tuesday'), (SELECT id FROM CUSTOMER WHERE name = 'Charles'));
Verification
Verify that the customer record is created:

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE name = 'Charles';
Verify that Charles is added to the route:

SELECT * FROM ROUTE_CUSTOMER WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM CUSTOMER WHERE name = 'Charles');
If you have any specific database or system to execute these actions, please let me know, and I can assist further.

Dave
