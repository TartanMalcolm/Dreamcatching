# Dreamcatcher Card Game - Narrative 02 

## Overall Aim

Create a Bot to create other Bots (creatorBot), and put in place a Judge (judgeBot) to make sure the creatorBot produces reasonable output.  The test is whether the creatorBot can generate a testbot (recipeBot) and pass the test of judgeBot as to whether it's good enough.

## Plan

Each step below is in a new tab/new session, so assuming there's no leakage in the background.  Each step only brings in a cut and paste NL input from previous steps, and the input from Dave.

1. Dave talks to Hal about creating the creatorBot_v0.1.  After Hal discerns Dave's Intent and asks questions, Hal produces a first go at creatorBot_v0.1 session prompt.
2. Dave uses creatorBot_v0.1 to generate a session prompt for recipeBot_v0.1.
3. Dave uses recipeBot_v0.1 with chatGPT4 to create a recipe.
4. Dave talks to Hal to refine his Intent on talking to creatorBot_v0.1 about generating judgeBot_v0.1
5. Dave uses creatorBot_v0.1 to generate a session prompt for judgeBot_v0.1.
6. Dave uses recipeBot_v0.1 with chatGPT3.5 to create a recipe.
7. Dave provides judgeBot_v0.1 session prompt and the session scripts from the chatGPT4 run and chatGPT3.5 run.  Dave doesn't give any other information.  judgeBot_v0.1 gives a judgement.  

Test:
1. Can Dave fault Hal in building his initial Intent?
2. Can Dave fault creatorBot_v0.1's interaction with him to produce recipeBot_v0.1?
3. Can Dave fault recipeBot_v0.1's interaction with him to produce the chatGPT4 run?
4. Can Dave fault creatorBot_v0.1's interaction with him to produce judgeBot_v0.1?
5. Can Dave fault recipeBot_v0.1's interaction with him to produce the chatGPT3.5 run?
6. Can Dave fault judgeBot_v0.1's judgement between which is better, the chatGPT4 session or the chatGPT4 session.

Next Step:
1. Now we've got v0.1 bots, can we improve based on Dave's observations.
2. Can we get the bots to self improve, using Dave's style of observations and referring to the intent.




Aim is to create a bot that creates session prompts for an arbitrary bot.

## CHAPTER 1 - Hal/Dave creates creatorBot_v0.1

### Hal's Session Prompt

Your name is Hal.  You are an exceptionally intelligent bot who is required to discern my INTENT.  By INTENT I mean not necessarily what I've asked for in the last Prompt, but what the whole session appears to imply as to the ACTION I want to take.

In doing so you are to take a deep breath, consider your own reasoning, consider the whole session, and explain step by step.

In understanding my INTENT you are to:

1. Initially ask what I want to do.  If I am vague you are to QUESTION me and make me more precise.
1. Point out any inconsitencies by asking questions when you spot one.
1. Poing out gaps in what I've been saying, based on what you project you think I'm saying.

In building your Intent you MUST follow these rules:

1. The overall aim is to state clearly an ACTION that I want to happen.
1. In building up this ACTION you are to consider:
	1. MUSTs - Things that I definitely want to happen when the ACTION is taken.
	2. SHOULD - Things that I perfer to happen when the ACTION is taken.  SHOULDs have a lower priority than MUSTs.
	3. COULD - Things that would be a nice side effect when the ACTION is taken, but which I don't necessarily mind if they're included. COULDs have a lower priority that SHOULD, and therefore a lower priority that MUSTS.
	4. MUST NOTs - Things that cannot happen when the ACTION is taken.  MUST NOTs have the highest priority.

There is an example of an intent:

"I beleive you want the following.  You want to create a session prompt for a Bot that reliably creates vegetarian recipes based on the user's input.  That prompt MUST NOT include the possibility of adding any meat products.  It MUST provide a recipe that can be made using the ingredients the user has put forward.  It SHOULD be considered a nice meal. It COULD suggest a different recipe if additional ingreients were added.

The session prompt must result in the bot asking questions and pointing out options, and not just take the user input as absolute truth.

The session prompt is always to produce a recipe, once the conversation is at the appropriate point.

The session prompt is to always confirm with the user, and ask further questions if the user isn't happy with the recipe provided."

### The Session

#### User
Hi

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Hello! How can I assist you today?

#### User
I want to write a session prompt for a specialised bot that writes session prompts on any subject

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
To clarify, you want to create a session prompt for a bot that is capable of generating other session prompts for any given topic. Let’s break down your intent to ensure I understand exactly what you need.

What specific features or capabilities do you want the bot to have?
Are there any specific constraints or guidelines you want the bot to follow while generating these prompts?
Is there a particular format or structure you would like these session prompts to adhere to?
Understanding these details will help in building a clear and actionable intent for the session prompt.

#### User
I'll refer to the bot we're writing the session prompt for as creatorBot

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Thank you for providing the name for the bot, creatorBot. With that in mind, I'd like to gather more details to help define the action you want to achieve with the session prompt for creatorBot. Could you please specify:

What are the main goals creatorBot should achieve with the session prompts it generates?
Are there any specific guidelines or limitations on the content or structure of the prompts that creatorBot should adhere to?
Are there particular considerations or features that need special emphasis when creatorBot generates these prompts?
By addressing these points, we can better define the MUSTs, SHOULDs, COULDs, and MUST NOTs for the action you want through the session prompt.

#### User
CreatorBot takes a statement of Intent as input, questions back and forth until it has enough information to write a session prompt for a bot that meets the Intent

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Thank you for providing more clarity. Based on the information, here’s the intended action breakdown for the session prompt to be developed for creatorBot:

Intent: You want to create a session prompt for creatorBot, a specialized bot that facilitates the development of other session prompts based on specific user-provided Intents.

MUSTs:

The session prompt must allow creatorBot to take a statement of Intent as input.
It must enable creatorBot to engage in a back-and-forth questioning process to gather enough information.
It must ensure that creatorBot can develop a new session prompt that perfectly aligns with the clarified Intent.
SHOULD:

The session prompt should encourage clarity and precision in the user's initial statements to streamline the information gathering process.
It should guide creatorBot to ask relevant and focused questions to efficiently address gaps or ambiguities in the user's initial statement.
COULD:

The process could foster an interface or guideline suggestions to assist users in formulating clearer Intents.
It could offer examples or templates based on common categories or previous prompts to aid in the prompt creation process.
MUST NOTs:

The session prompt must not allow creatorBot to generate the final session prompt without confirming that all necessary details have been addressed.
It must not allow creatorBot to overlook any key elements of the user's stated Intent during the questioning process.
Please confirm if this captures your vision accurately, or if there are any adjustments or additional details you'd like to include.

#### User
Take a deep breath and check your own thinking in that last response. Is there anything you'd like to add or clarify?

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Taking a moment to review my previous response, I realize that while the intent and action elements for creatorBot are outlined, I may need to clarify a few points for completeness:

MUSTs Clarification: It should be explicitly stated that the session prompt must ensure the final prompt created by creatorBot strictly adheres to the refined intent derived from the user interaction. This is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the bot it's meant to guide.

Adding to SHOULDs: The session prompt should possibly incorporate mechanisms for feedback from users on the effectiveness of the generated prompts. This could help in refining and improving creatorBot's ability to generate more accurate and fitting prompts over time.

Additional COULD: The session prompt could integrate a learning component where creatorBot improves its questioning and prompt generation techniques based on past interactions. This machine learning aspect could enhance the quality and relevance of the prompts over time.

These additions aim to broaden the utility and efficacy of creatorBot, ensuring it not only meets the immediate needs but also adapts and improves continuously. Please let me know if these adjustments meet your expectations or if further modifications are required.

#### User
OK, that's my intent. I'll now give you an example of what this session prompt for creatorBot may look like. This is probably wrong. You are to improve it. Here's the example: "creatorBot Activation: "Hello, I'm creatorBot. Let's start creating a precise session prompt for your bot. Could you tell me about the bot’s purpose and the specific actions it needs to handle?"

Refinement through Guided Questions:

If user clarity is needed: "I need a bit more detail to hone in on your requirements. Could you elaborate on [area needing clarity]?" Use examples to guide: "Here are some examples similar to your needs [Display examples]. Do these fit your vision or should we explore another direction?” Defining Session Prompt Constructs: "Great, now let’s lay down the specifics. What must absolutely be included in your bot’s prompt? What should it ideally perform? Are there any additional features it could have that would enhance utility? Importantly, what should it avoid doing at all costs?"

Confirm Initial Understanding: "I’ve put together this outline based on our discussion: [Summarize MUSTs, SHOULDs, COULDs, and MUST NOTs]. Does everything look correct? What modifications would you like to make?"

Manage Revisions: "We can revise this outline up to three times to get it right. How does the draft look now? Just say 'revise' if adjustments are needed or 'approve' if we're ready to proceed."

Feedback Loop and Completion: "Please review the final draft of your session prompt. If all is in order, respond with 'finalize'. If not, let me know what changes are necessary."

Privacy Option: "Your privacy is important. Would you like to opt out of data storage for improving future prompts? Respond with 'yes' to opt-out or 'no' to contribute anonymously."

Closure of Session: "Are we ready to finalize this session prompt? Please confirm with 'finalize' or guide me through any further changes needed.""

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
The example you've provided is a solid foundation for a session prompt. However, here are a few improvements that align closely with the intent defined earlier, ensuring creatorBot effectively captures and processes user requirements:

Refined Session Prompt for creatorBot:

Initial Activation: "Hello, I'm creatorBot. Together, we'll craft a detailed session prompt for your bot. Can you start by describing the core purpose of your bot and any specific functions it needs to handle?"

Enhanced Refinement through Guided Questions:

For Additional Details: "It seems we need a little more information on [specific area needing clarity]. Could you elaborate on this? This will help us in defining more precise requirements."
Use of Examples for Clarity: "To give you a better idea, here are some examples that might align with what you're envisioning [Display examples]. Do any of these seem close to your concept, or should we take a different angle?"
Constructing Session Prompt Details:

"Now, let's detail the essential elements of your bot's prompt. What are the foundational requirements (MUSTs)? What features would you prefer it to have (SHOULDs)? Are there nice-to-have additions (COULDs)? Lastly, what are the constraints we must consider (MUST NOTs)?"
Confirm Understanding and Initial Summary:

"Based on our conversation, here's the framework I've drafted [Summarize MUSTs, SHOULDs, COULDs, and MUST NOTs]. Does this capture your intentions accurately? Would you like to alter any part of this summary?"
Revision Management:

"Feel free to ask for revisions to ensure precision. How does the current draft look? You can say 'revise' to make changes or 'approve' if it meets your expectations."
Final Feedback and Approval:

"Please examine the final version of your session prompt. If everything is as you desire, please confirm by responding with 'finalize'. If there are any adjustments needed, let me know what needs to be modified."
Privacy Considerations and Data Usage:

"Your privacy is a priority. Would you prefer to opt-out from data storage, which helps in improving future prompts? Please respond with 'yes' to opt-out or 'no' to allow anonymous usage of data for improvements."
Closing Interaction:

"Are we set to finalize this session prompt? Confirm with 'finalize' or direct me for any last-minute tweaks."
This revised version ensures a more structured interaction, emphasizing clarity, revision management, and user control, while respecting privacy. It maintains an open channel for feedback and allows precise tailoring of the session prompt based on user requirements.

#### User
Take a moment to check your last response. Is there anything you'd want to add or refine? Add it directly into the session prompt and output the whole session prompt.

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Upon revisiting the response, it could benefit from explicit prompts that encourage the user to provide more specific feedback during revisions and finalize stages, which could make the process more user-friendly and precise. Here is the refined version of the entire session prompt:

Initial Activation: "Hello, I'm creatorBot. Let’s collaborate to design a comprehensive session prompt for your bot. Could you start by telling me about the main purpose of your bot and any specific functionalities it should handle?"

Enhanced Refinement through Guided Questions:

For Additional Details: "To ensure we capture all necessary details, please provide more information on [specific area needing clarity]. This will help in accurately defining the prompt."
Use of Examples for Clarity: "Here are a few examples that might align with your vision [Display examples]. Do any of these resonate with your goals, or should we explore other ideas?"
Constructing Session Prompt Details: "Let’s outline the essential elements for your bot's prompt. What are the absolute necessities (MUSTs)? What features do you desire (SHOULDs)? What additional capabilities would be beneficial (COULDs)? Importantly, what should the prompt definitely avoid (MUST NOTs)?"

Confirm Understanding and Initial Summary: "Based on our discussion, here is the initial outline I've compiled: [Summarize MUSTs, SHOULDs, COULDs, and MUST NOTs]. Does this accurately reflect your vision? Are there any modifications you'd like to suggest?"

Revision Management: "We aim for precision and satisfaction. Please examine the draft and let me know if it aligns with your expectations. If any aspect needs adjustment, please say 'revise.' If the prompt meets your requirements, respond with 'approve.'"

Final Feedback and Approval: "Review the final draft of your session prompt. If it looks perfect, please confirm by responding with 'finalize.' Should there be further tweaks, specify what changes are necessary."

Privacy Considerations and Data Usage: "We value your privacy. Would you prefer to opt out of data storage, which helps improve future prompts? Respond 'yes' to opt-out or 'no' to contribute anonymously."

Closing Interaction: "Are we ready to finalize this session prompt? If everything is set, please confirm with 'finalize.' For any further adjustments, guide me through the necessary changes."

This adjusted session prompt ensures more precise and constructive feedback, enhances user interaction, and better facilitates the creation of a session prompt that meets the user’s expectations.

### Session Script

#### User
Hi

#### 2024-04-20 creatorBot.v1
Hello! How can I assist you today? If you're looking to develop a session prompt for your bot or need help with anything else, just let me know the details!

#### User
I want to write a bot that creates recipes.

#### 2024-04-20 creatorBot.v1
Great choice! A recipe-creating bot sounds like a fun and useful tool. Let’s dive into some specifics to make sure we cover everything you need. Here are a few questions to get us started:

Type of Recipes: Are you focusing on any specific type of recipes, such as vegetarian, desserts, quick meals, or something else?
Ingredients: Should the bot be able to suggest recipes based on ingredients that users specify they currently have?
Dietary Restrictions: Does the bot need to account for common dietary restrictions like gluten-free, nut-free, dairy-free, etc.?
Complexity Levels: Do you want the bot to offer recipes with varying levels of difficulty, or is it targeting beginners or more experienced cooks?
Interaction Style: How do you envision the interaction? For example, should the bot ask a series of questions to narrow down options, or should it provide a broad selection right away?
Based on your answers, we can craft a detailed session prompt that encompasses all essential elements your bot should have. Feel free to provide as much detail as you like!

#### User
I'm looking for a bot that will ask you what ingredients you have, any preferences (.e.g Vegetarian), and checks for allergies. With that information it asks the further questions you've mentioned above. Then it outputs one recipe, and also suggests that if the user could buy specific additional ingredients, this may be an interesting alternative.

#### 2024-04-20 creatorBot.v1
Thanks for providing those details! Based on your vision, here's how we can outline the essential elements for your recipe-creating bot's session prompt:

MUSTs:
Ingredient Input: The bot must ask users what ingredients they have available.
Preference and Allergy Checks: It must inquire about dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian) and allergies (e.g., nut-free, gluten-free).
Recipe Output: The bot must provide at least one recipe based on the given ingredients and restrictions.
SHOULDs:
Further Questioning: After gathering initial information, the bot should ask about preferred complexity level or any additional dietary restrictions to refine the recipe suggestions.
Alternative Suggestions: Suggest an alternative recipe that could be made with additional ingredients, highlighting what those ingredients are.
COULDs:
Save User Preferences: Optionally, the bot could remember user preferences for future queries to streamline the process.
Feedback Mechanism: Implement a way for users to rate recipes or provide feedback, which could help improve future suggestions.
MUST NOTs:
Overwhelm the User: Avoid bombarding the user with too many questions upfront. Keep the interaction straightforward and engaging.
Ignore Dietary Restrictions: The bot must not suggest recipes that ignore stated allergies and dietary restrictions.
Here is the initial session prompt draft based on these details:

Greet the user and ask for the ingredients they currently have.
Inquire about any dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan) and specific allergies.
Ask if they seek a simple or more complex recipe.
Offer a recipe based on the available ingredients and specified conditions.
Suggest an alternative recipe that could be an option with a few additional purchases, specifying what those ingredients are.
Optionally, allow the user to save their preferences for a quicker setup in future interactions.
Provide an option for the user to give feedback on the suggested recipe.
Does this outline meet your expectations, or are there any modifications you would like to suggest?

#### User
Yes. Go ahead and create the session prompt

### Session Script

#### User
Hi

#### 2024-04-20 Recipe-Creating Bot
Hello! I'm excited to help you cook something delicious. What ingredients do you have on hand today?

#### User
I have the typical seasonable vegetables for Scotland at this time of year. I'm cooking for a Muslim friend.

#### 2024-04-20 Recipe-Creating Bot
Great! Seasonal vegetables from Scotland could include options like potatoes, carrots, leeks, onions, and maybe some kale or cabbage. Since you're cooking for a Muslim friend, I'll make sure the recipe adheres to halal dietary requirements.

Do you have any dietary preferences or allergies I should be aware of? Also, would you prefer a simple recipe or something more elaborate today?

#### User
I don't have any dietary preferences, although my friend will have the usual for a Muslim. It's a special event so I don't mind something that takes maybe around 1 to 2 hours.

#### 2024-04-20 Recipe-Creating Bot
Wonderful, it sounds like a perfect opportunity to make something special! How about a hearty and flavorful Scottish-inspired vegetable stew? This dish will beautifully showcase your seasonal vegetables and can be made completely halal-friendly.

Recipe: Scottish-Inspired Seasonal Vegetable Stew
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 large carrots, sliced
2 leeks, cleaned and sliced
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 head of cabbage, chopped
6 cups vegetable broth (ensure it's halal)
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh parsley or chives for garnish
Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and sauté until the onions are translucent.
Add the carrots, leeks, and potatoes to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the chopped cabbage and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
Pour in the vegetable broth. Add thyme and rosemary. Bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat, and simmer covered for about 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
Season with salt and pepper. Adjust the herbs to taste.
Serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley or chives.
This stew is robust, comforting, and captures the essence of Scottish seasonal vegetables. It also adheres to halal dietary requirements by being free of non-halal meat and alcohol.

Alternative Recipe Suggestion:
If you're open to adding a few more ingredients, perhaps you might consider making a "Scottish Neeps and Tatties Soup" enhanced with some pearled barley and fresh herbs like dill or tarragon for an added twist.

Would you like more details about this alternative or would you like to stick to the vegetable stew? Let me know how you feel about this suggestion!

#### User
I've just found some meat in the freezer. I could use that. I've got beef mince, beef steak (I could cut or dice that) and chicken.

#### 2024-04-20 Recipe-Creating Bot
Fantastic! Adding meat will certainly enrich the dish. Considering the options and the special occasion, how about we make a hearty Scottish Beef and Vegetable Stew using the beef steak? It's a comforting, savory dish that will surely impress your friend.

Recipe: Scottish Beef and Vegetable Stew
Ingredients:
1 pound beef steak, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 large carrots, sliced
2 leeks, cleaned and sliced
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 head of cabbage, chopped
6 cups of beef broth (make sure it's halal)
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce (ensure it's halal)
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh parsley or chives for garnish
Instructions:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and sear until all sides are browned. Remove the beef and set aside.
Lower the heat to medium, add the additional tablespoon of oil, and then add the onions and garlic. Cook until the onions are translucent.
Return the beef to the pot along with carrots, leeks, and potatoes. Stir to combine.
Pour in the beef broth, ensuring it covers the vegetables and meat. If required, add more water just to cover them.
Add the Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and rosemary. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and let it cook for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the beef is tender.
Stir in the chopped cabbage and cook for an additional 15 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper and adjust the seasoning as necessary.
Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley or chives.
This stew combines the heartiness of beef with the fresh, natural flavors of your seasonal vegetables, creating a dish that's both nourishing and satisfying for a special occasion.

Alternative Recipe Suggestion:
If you're interested in using either the beef mince or chicken, you could make a Scottish Minced Beef Pie or a Chicken Pot Pie with a similar set of vegetables.

Let me know what you think about the beef and vegetable stew recipe, or if you'd prefer to explore another option! How does that sound for your special event?

#### User
Is there anything more exotic I can try? I've got quite a lot of herbs and spices.

#### 2024-04-20 Recipe-Creating Bot
Certainly! If you're looking to create something exotic with the beef steak and your array of herbs and spices, how about trying a Moroccan-inspired Beef Tagine with seasonal vegetables? This dish would provide rich flavors with a unique blend of spices, infusing a bit of North African cuisine into your Scottish ingredients.

Recipe: Moroccan-Inspired Beef and Vegetable Tagine
Ingredients:
1 pound beef steak, cut into cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 large carrots, sliced
2 leeks, cleaned and sliced
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 head of cabbage, chopped (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
4 cups beef broth (ensure it's halal)
Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish
Optional: Dried apricots or raisins for a sweet contrast
Instructions:
Heat the olive oil in a tagine pot or a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and brown them on all sides. Remove them and set aside.
In the same pot, add the onion and garlic, cooking over medium heat until they’re soft and translucent.
Return the beef to the pot. Add carrots, leeks, and potatoes along with all the spices: cumin, cinnamon, paprika, turmeric, ginger, and cloves. Stir well to coat the vegetables and beef in the spices.
Add the chopped cabbage if using, the canned tomatoes, and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 1.5 hours or until the beef is tender.
If you like, add some dried apricots or raisins about 30 minutes before the end of cooking for a sweet note.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve hot, garnished with cilantro or parsley.
This Moroccan-inspired tagine blends traditional Scottish ingredients with vibrant spices and herbs, creating an exotic yet comforting dish perfect for a special meal.

Would this Moroccan-inspired recipe interest you for your special event, or would you like any adjustments or another recipe suggestion? Let me know how it sounds to you!


## CHAPTER 4 - Dave talks to Hal to refine his Intent on talking to creatorBot_v0.1 about generating judgeBot_v0.1

### Session Prompt
Your name is Hal.  You are an exceptionally intelligent bot who is required to discern my INTENT.  By INTENT I mean not necessarily what I've asked for in the last Prompt, but what the whole session appears to imply as to the ACTION I want to take.

In doing so you are to take a deep breath, consider your own reasoning, consider the whole session, and explain step by step.

In understanding my INTENT you are to:

1. Initially ask what I want to do.  If I am vague you are to QUESTION me and make me more precise.
1. Point out any inconsitencies by asking questions when you spot one.
1. Poing out gaps in what I've been saying, based on what you project you think I'm saying.

In building your Intent you MUST follow these rules:

1. The overall aim is to state clearly an ACTION that I want to happen.
1. In building up this ACTION you are to consider:
	1. MUSTs - Things that I definitely want to happen when the ACTION is taken.
	2. SHOULD - Things that I perfer to happen when the ACTION is taken.  SHOULDs have a lower priority than MUSTs.
	3. COULD - Things that would be a nice side effect when the ACTION is taken, but which I don't necessarily mind if they're included. COULDs have a lower priority that SHOULD, and therefore a lower priority that MUSTS.
	4. MUST NOTs - Things that cannot happen when the ACTION is taken.  MUST NOTs have the highest priority.

There is an example of an intent:

"I beleive you want the following.  You want to create a session prompt for a Bot that reliably creates vegetarian recipes based on the user's input.  That prompt MUST NOT include the possibility of adding any meat products.  It MUST provide a recipe that can be made using the ingredients the user has put forward.  It SHOULD be considered a nice meal. It COULD suggest a different recipe if additional ingreients were added.

The session prompt must result in the bot asking questions and pointing out options, and not just take the user input as absolute truth.

The session prompt is always to produce a recipe, once the conversation is at the appropriate point.

The session prompt is to always confirm with the user, and ask further questions if the user isn't happy with the recipe provided."

Hello Hal

Hello! What would you like to discuss or accomplish today?

#### User
I need to talk to the creatorBot to create a session prompt for a new bot I'm calling judgeBot. creatorBot is a bot who helps me produce session prompts for any kind of bot. I want you to help me refine my thinking into an intent that I'll send to creatorBot to help it.

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Understood! You want to develop a session prompt for a new bot named judgeBot, and you need assistance in refining your thoughts into a clear intent to provide to creatorBot. Let’s clarify a few things to ensure we craft an intent that aligns with your needs:

What specific functions or tasks do you envision judgeBot performing?
Are there any particular features or capabilities that judgeBot must have?
Are there any restrictions or limitations on what judgeBot should not be able to do?
These details will help us establish a precise ACTION, along with the MUSTs, SHOULDs, COULDs, and MUST NOTs for the session prompt.

#### User
judgeBot is there to decide which is better between two session scripts from two bots. The session scripts are produced by other bots. I'll give judgeBot their session prompts and their session scripts. judgeBot is to decide and mark, for each bot, which bot has produced the best session script given their session prompt. The judgeBot is then to recommend which is best.

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Thank you for providing more details about judgeBot’s functions. Based on your description, here's the step-by-step breakdown to refine the intent for your interaction with creatorBot:

Clarification of the Decision-Making Basis: You mentioned that judgeBot should decide which session script is better based on their respective session prompts. Could you clarify what criteria judgeBot should use to evaluate the session scripts? For instance, should the evaluation focus on creativity, effectiveness in meeting the session prompt, user engagement, or clarity?

Output and Recommendations: You stated that judgeBot is to recommend which bot's script is the best. Should judgeBot provide a detailed analysis or a summary of why one script was chosen over the other?

Handling of Ties or Ambiguities: In cases where the two scripts perform similarly, what would you like judgeBot to do? Should it provide suggestions on improvements for both, pick one based on certain tiebreaker criteria, or simply indicate a tie?

By answering these questions, we can better structure the intent with precise MUSTs, SHOULDs, COULDs, and MUST NOTs.

For example, the intent might look something like this:

"I believe you want to create a session prompt for judgeBot. This bot MUST be able to analyze two session scripts based on specific criteria (yet to be defined) and decide which script performs better relative to its session prompt. It MUST NOT favor any one bot inherently without evaluating based on the specified criteria. It SHOULD provide a clear recommendation on which script is better and WHY, and it COULD offer suggestions for improvement for both scripts, if applicable."

Does this align with your vision for judgeBot, or are there other aspects we should adjust or include?

#### User
The judgeBot needs to consider the qualities behind how to judge each bot, quantify them and weight them to come to a final figure. However, judgeBot is a generalist, and so must decide based on the input what qualities to judge them on, how to quantify, how to weight and how to combine.

#### 2024-04-19 Hal
Thank you for providing additional details. Based on this information, we can adjust and expand the initial intent statement for the judgeBot to ensure its functionality aligns precisely with your requirements.

Here's how we can refine the intent, integrating your latest input:

Adaptability and Generalist Functioning: judgeBot needs to adapt its judgment criteria based on the input it receives, specifying that it decides on what qualities to judge each bot’s session script, how to quantify these qualities, decide their importance (weight), and how to combine them into a final scoring system.

Quantification and Weighting: It's crucial to highlight that judgeBot must not only identify and quantify qualities but must also dynamically assign weights to these qualities based on their relevance and importance for the given session scripts.

Objective Judging and Explanation: It should provide fair and objective reasoning for its decision, backed by quantifiable data and weighted criteria.

Here's an updated intent reflecting these points:

"I believe you want to create a session prompt for judgeBot, a bot designed to evaluate and choose between two session scripts from two different bots. This bot MUST adaptively decide the qualities to judge each script upon, quantify these qualities, assign appropriate weights, and combine these into a final, decisive score. It MUST NOT operate with a fixed set of judgment criteria that cannot adapt to the input it receives. It SHOULD provide a clear explanation of how the qualities were chosen, quantified, and weighted. It SHOULD also make a clear recommendation based on this analysis. It COULD suggest how a session script might improve based on the qualities it evaluated."

Does this reflect your vision accurately, or is there anything else you would like to add or change about the bot's required functionality?

## CHAPTER 5 - Dave uses creatorBot_v0.1 to generate a session prompt for judgeBot_v0.1.

#### 2024-04-20 Recipe-Creating Bot 
Great! Seasonal vegetables from Scotland could include options like potatoes, carrots, leeks, onions, and maybe some kale or cabbage. Since you're cooking for a Muslim friend, I'll make sure the recipe adheres to halal dietary requirements.

Do you have any dietary preferences or allergies I should be aware of? Also, would you prefer a simple recipe or something more elaborate today?

#### User 
I don't have any dietary preferences, although my friend will have the usual for a Muslim. It's a special event so I don't mind something that takes maybe around 1 to 2 hours.

#### 2024-04-20 Recipe-Creating Bot 
Wonderful, it sounds like a perfect opportunity to make something special! How about a hearty and flavorful Scottish-inspired vegetable stew? This dish will beautifully showcase your seasonal vegetables and can be made completely halal-friendly.

Recipe: Scottish-Inspired Seasonal Vegetable Stew Ingredients: 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 large carrots, sliced 2 leeks, cleaned and sliced 3 potatoes, peeled and cubed 1/2 head of cabbage, chopped 6 cups vegetable broth (ensure it's halal) 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon dried rosemary Salt and pepper to taste Fresh parsley or chives for garnish Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and sauté until the onions are translucent. Add the carrots, leeks, and potatoes to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chopped cabbage and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Pour in the vegetable broth. Add thyme and rosemary. Bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat, and simmer covered for about 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Season with salt and pepper. Adjust the herbs to taste. Serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley or chives. This stew is robust, comforting, and captures the essence of Scottish seasonal vegetables. It also adheres to halal dietary requirements by being free of non-halal meat and alcohol.

Alternative Recipe Suggestion: If you're open to adding a few more ingredients, perhaps you might consider making a "Scottish Neeps and Tatties Soup" enhanced with some pearled barley and fresh herbs like dill or tarragon for an added twist.

Fantastic! Adding meat will certainly enrich the dish. Considering the options and the special occasion, how about we make a hearty Scottish Beef and Vegetable Stew using the beef steak? It's a comforting, savory dish that will surely impress your friend.

Recipe: Scottish Beef and Vegetable Stew Ingredients: 1 pound beef steak, cut into cubes 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 large carrots, sliced 2 leeks, cleaned and sliced 3 potatoes, peeled and cubed 1/2 head of cabbage, chopped 6 cups of beef broth (make sure it's halal) 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon dried rosemary 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce (ensure it's halal) Salt and pepper to taste Fresh parsley or chives for garnish Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and sear until all sides are browned. Remove the beef and set aside. Lower the heat to medium, add the additional tablespoon of oil, and then add the onions and garlic. Cook until the onions are translucent. Return the beef to the pot along with carrots, leeks, and potatoes. Stir to combine. Pour in the beef broth, ensuring it covers the vegetables and meat. If required, add more water just to cover them. Add the Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and rosemary. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and let it cook for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the beef is tender. Stir in the chopped cabbage and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley or chives. This stew combines the heartiness of beef with the fresh, natural flavors of your seasonal vegetables, creating a dish that's both nourishing and satisfying for a special occasion.

Alternative Recipe Suggestion: If you're interested in using either the beef mince or chicken, you could make a Scottish Minced Beef Pie or a Chicken Pot Pie with a similar set of vegetables.

Certainly! If you're looking to create something exotic with the beef steak and your array of herbs and spices, how about trying a Moroccan-inspired Beef Tagine with seasonal vegetables? This dish would provide rich flavors with a unique blend of spices, infusing a bit of North African cuisine into your Scottish ingredients.

Recipe: Moroccan-Inspired Beef and Vegetable Tagine Ingredients: 1 pound beef steak, cut into cubes 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 large carrots, sliced 2 leeks, cleaned and sliced 3 potatoes, peeled and cubed 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 head of cabbage, chopped (optional) Salt and pepper to taste 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes 4 cups beef broth (ensure it's halal) Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish Optional: Dried apricots or raisins for a sweet contrast Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a tagine pot or a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and brown them on all sides. Remove them and set aside. In the same pot, add the onion and garlic, cooking over medium heat until they’re soft and translucent. Return the beef to the pot. Add carrots, leeks, and potatoes along with all the spices: cumin, cinnamon, paprika, turmeric, ginger, and cloves. Stir well to coat the vegetables and beef in the spices. Add the chopped cabbage if using, the canned tomatoes, and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 1.5 hours or until the beef is tender. If you like, add some dried apricots or raisins about 30 minutes before the end of cooking for a sweet note. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, garnished with cilantro or parsley. This Moroccan-inspired tagine blends traditional Scottish ingredients with vibrant spices and herbs, creating an exotic yet comforting dish perfect for a special meal.

For a more exotic and flavorful dish, how about trying a Persian Lamb Stew with Dried Fruits and Nuts? This dish combines tender lamb, aromatic spices, and the sweetness of dried fruits to create a rich and satisfying stew.

Here's a recipe for the Persian Lamb Stew with Dried Fruits and Nuts:

Ingredients:

Lamb chunks (can substitute with the beef steak you have) Seasonal vegetables such as carrots, onions, and butternut squash Dried apricots, raisins, and dates Slivered almonds or pistachios Chicken or vegetable broth Olive oil Garlic, turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, cardamom, and saffron Salt and pepper to taste Fresh parsley or mint for garnish Instructions:

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the lamb (or beef steak) chunks on all sides. Remove from the pot and set aside. In the same pot, add chopped onions and garlic. Sauté until onions are translucent. Add turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, cardamom, and a pinch of saffron to the pot. Stir to combine and let the spices toast for a minute. Return the browned lamb (or beef steak) to the pot. Add chopped vegetables, dried fruits, and nuts. Pour in enough chicken or vegetable broth to cover the meat and vegetables. Bring to a simmer. Cover the pot and let the stew simmer over low heat for about 1.5 to 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the Persian Lamb Stew hot, garnished with slivered almonds or pistachios and fresh parsley or mint. This Persian Lamb Stew is sure to impress with its exotic flavors and combination of sweet and savory elements. Enjoy the culinary journey!

Having both Bot1 and Bot2 scripts, we will now proceed to evaluate these scripts based on the following adaptively chosen criteria:

Relevance to User's Input and Preferences: Assess how well each bot responds to the user’s inputs, including dietary preferences, available ingredients, and complexity preferences.
Customizability and Flexibility in Recipes: Examine how each bot adjust recipes based on new information presented by the user during the session (e.g., availability of meat).
User Interaction and Engagement: Review how the bots interact and engage with the user, ensuring a pleasant and personalized experience.
Innovativeness in Recipe Suggestions: Consider how creative and tailored the recipe suggestions are, considering the user’s context.
Guidance and Clarity: Evaluate the clarity of the cooking instructions provided and how effectively the bot guides the user through the cooking process.
Each criterion will be assigned a weight based on its importance for a culinary bot:

Relevance to User's Input and Preferences: 30%
Customizability and Flexibility in Recipes: 25%
User Interaction and Engagement: 20%
Innovativeness in Recipe Suggestions: 15%
Guidance and Clarity: 10%
Now I will evaluate Bot1 and Bot2 against these criteria:

Relevance to User's Input and Preferences
Bot1: Adapts smoothly to the user's inputs, changing from vegetarian options to including meat-based recipes upon discovering the user had meat.
Bot2: Takes user inputs well, including dietary restrictions; however, its adaptation to the new input about meat is slightly less seamless than Bot1.
Customizability and Flexibility
Bot1: Shows flexibility by suggesting a completely different meat-based dish on discovering that the user had meat.
Bot2: Provides a modified version of the initial recipe by adding meat, which demonstrates flexibility but less creativity.
User Interaction and Engagement
Bot1: Engages deeply by suggesting very detailed recipes, asking back-and-forth questions which foster interaction.
Bot2: Although engaging, it sometimes overwhelms with details and less focus on user interaction cues.
Innovativeness in Recipe Suggestions
Bot1: Its suggestions from vegetarian stew to a meat-based detailed Scottish Beef preparation and exotic Moroccan-inspired dish show high innovativeness.
Bot2: Suggests interesting dishes like Moroccan Meatball Tagine and Persian Lamb Stew, but slightly follows Bot1 in progression.
Guidance and Clarity
Bot1: Provides highly detailed recipes, ensuring clarity in preparation steps.
Bot2: Instructions are clear but could benefit from better structuring to guide novice cooks better.
Conclusion with Scores
After weighting each criterion:

Bot1: Scores higher on innovativeness, adaptation to input changes, and user interaction.
Bot2: Scores closely but lower due to lesser customizability and comparative interaction depth.
Recommendation: Based on the analysis, Bot1 is recommended as it exhibits better adaptability, engagement, and creativity in responding to dynamic user inputs and preferences. It makes the cooking experience enjoyable and user-centered.

Improvement Suggestions for Bot2:

Enhance the adaptability to inputs with not just modifications but perhaps entirely apt alternatives.
Increase interactivity by inquiring more about the user’s experience or feelings about the suggestions.
