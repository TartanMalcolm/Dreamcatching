# DREAMCATCHER

## Definitions

**Contribution**: Any input, effort, or service provided by an individual or entity that directly or indirectly impacts the development, creation, or improvement of a system, product, or process. Contributions can take many forms, including but not limited to coding, project management, mentoring, investing resources, or providing support services. Each contribution is recognized as adding value to the overall project and is recorded through mechanisms like state changes. Contributions are a key factor in determining attribution, which is the process of assigning value or credit to the various contributors based on the impact of their efforts on the final outcome.

**Contributor**: An individual or entity that provides effort, resources, or services to a project or system, leading to a state change or improvement. Contributors play a direct role in the creation, modification, or enhancement of the product or process. Their contributions can include activities such as coding, project management, mentoring, or any other tasks that result in a tangible or intangible output. Contributors are distinct from investors or consumers, as they are actively involved in the development process and their contributions are essential for the project's progress and success. The value and impact of a contributor's work are evaluated to determine their share in the attribution and reward system.

**State Change**: Any modification of a product that alters its current condition, including the addition of new features, bug fixes, raising issues or updating existing functionalities. A state changes are meaningful events used to calculate attributions, impacts, or other relevant metrics. 

**Consumer**: An entity (which could be an individual, organization, or system) that utilizes or benefits from a product, service, or outcome generated by the contributions and investments within the system. Unlike an investor or contributor, a consumer does not directly participate in the creation or funding of the product but derives value from its use. The consumer's interaction with the product generates impact, which is then used to calculate the value or attribution of that product to the various contributors and investors involved in its creation. The consumer's behavior and the resulting impact are crucial for determining how resources and credits are dispersed among those who contributed to or invested in the product.

**Effort**: The work or input provided by contributors that leads to the creation, modification, or enhancement of a system, product, or service. This can include activities such as coding, designing, testing, project management, mentoring, and other tasks that result in a state change within the system. Effort is considered a form of contribution, distinct from financial investment, and is a key factor in determining attribution and value within the system. The value of effort is evaluated based on its impact and may be compared or weighted against other contributions like capital or prior art.

**Output**: The tangible state changes generated from the efforts and contributions of individuals or systems. This includes the final deliverables, such as code, documentation, business rules, or any other artifacts that represent a completed or progressed state change within the system. Output is the measurable result of the work done (effort) and is critical for evaluating the value and impact of contributions. The quality and relevance of the output play a significant role in determining how attribution and rewards are allocated among the contributors and investors involved.

**Services**: Aactions, tasks, or support provided by contributors that facilitate the development, maintenance, or improvement of a product. These services can include activities such as mentoring, consulting, project management, technical support, or any other roles that contribute indirectly to the creation of tangible outputs. While services may not result in direct outputs like code or documentation, they are essential for enabling and enhancing the overall productivity and effectiveness of the project. Services are considered a form of contribution and are factored into the attribution and valuation process, recognizing the importance of these roles in the successful delivery of the final product or outcome.


**Actor**: Any individual, entity, or system that plays a role in the processes within the Dreamcatcher. This includes contributors, investors and consumers. Each actor's actions are considered in the attribution process to determine their share of value or credit within the system.

**Investor**: Investor is an individual or entity that provides capital, resources, or other forms of value to support the development, creation, or enhancement of a system, product, or process. Unlike contributors who directly engage in producing outputs or services, investors typically contribute financial resources or other forms of support, such as intellectual property or strategic guidance, without directly creating the tangible output themselves. The role of the investor is to enable and facilitate the project's progress by supplying the necessary resources.

**Stuck**: A situation or problem that has halted progress within a project or process. When someone encounters a stuck, they are unable to move forward due to an unresolved issue. When an Actor creates a Stuck the issue is made public and other Actors are invited to address or solve it. Stucks may be backed by through escrow by an investor to incentivise solving the issue.

**Impact**:  refers to the measurable effect or influence that a contribution, investment, or consumption has in the real world. Impact is a key factor in determining the value and attribution of efforts within the system. Impact is used to calculate how resources, rewards, or credits should be distributed among the different actors—contributors, investors, and consumers. 

**Impact Crystal**: A model used to represent the multi-dimensional impact of contributions, investments, and consumption within the system. Impact Crystals can represent an artbitrary list of dimensions, such as financial value, social influence, environmental benefits, or technological advancement.  Impact Crystals are calculated at an Event by first normalising the ratio within each dimension, comparing like by like, then proposing a ratio between dimensions.  In this way any Dispersal Event (e.g. a cash payment) can be distributed fairly and transparently.   Impact Crystals acknowledge that impact is complex and multi-faceted, and provides a structured way to assess and attribute value in a fair and transparent manner.

**Dispersal Event**: The process where the accumulated value, resources, or rewards within the system are distributed among the various actors—contributors, investors, and possibly consumers—based on the impact they have generated. This event occurs after an impact has been measured and analyzed through an Impact Crystal.

During a dispersal event, the system calculates how much each actor is owed or credited, taking into account the contributions they made, the investments they provided, and the impact their actions have had on the overall project. The dispersal event ensures that value is fairly and accurately allocated according to the established rules and the results of the impact analysis.

**Platform Admin**: Platform Admin are individuals or entities responsible for overseeing, maintaining, and managing the technical and operational aspects of the Dreamcatcher. Their role includes ensuring the platform runs smoothly, implementing necessary updates or changes, and addressing any issues that arise within the system. Currently Platform Admin has the authority to make decisions about the platform's functionality, security, and overall governance.  In future this may be devolved to the community.


**AI Auditor**: An automated AI tool that is responsible for reviewing, evaluating, and ensuring the accuracy, fairness, and transparency of attribution, dispersal events, and impact assessments.  AI Auditors help maintain trust in the system by providing an independent, automated check on the actions of the Dreamcatcher. They act as a safeguard against errors, biases, or manipulations within the platform's operations, ensuring that all actors—contributors, investors, and consumers—are treated fairly according to the established rules.

**Artifact**: The underlying operating system which provides compute facilities, storage, file manipulation and work flows withing the Dreamcatcher. 

**Business Rules**: A set of guidelines or criteria that dictate the functioning and decision-making processes within the Dreamcatcher and Apps running on Artifact.

**Event**: Any significant action, occurrence, or change within the Dreamcatcher that triggers a response or leads to a state change. Events can include a wide range of activities, such as a commit, the completion of a task, the alteration of Artifact, or a dispersal event.

**Ambient Attribution**: A process designed to automatically capture, track, and record contributions made by users in real-time, leveraging blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each contribution is tokenized as an NFT, serving as a unique and verifiable digital asset that represents the contributor's work. NFT's can be tradable, and act as the dimensions in an Impact Crystal.  This system ensures that recognition and rewards are based on the tangible impact of contributions rather than the time invested.

Key aspects of Ambient Attribution include:

- Automatic Recording: Contributions are automatically recorded without the need for manual intervention, ensuring that every piece of work is documented as it occurs.

- NFTs for Contributions: Each contribution is tokenized as an NFT, providing a unique, immutable, and verifiable record of the work done. This tokenization allows for easy tracking and management of contributions, simplifying the process of attribution.

- Recognition and Rewards: Contributors are recognized and rewarded based on the actual impact of their contributions. The system evaluates how each contribution is used and its overall effect on the platform and its projects, promoting a merit-based reward structure.

- Fair and Transparent Distribution: The system ensures that rewards are distributed fairly and transparently, based on the real value and impact of the contributions. This promotes equity and discourages reliance on factors like time spent, focusing instead on the quality and usefulness of the work.

- Enhanced Accountability: By using NFTs to track contributions, Ambient Attribution creates a clear, immutable record of who contributed what and when. This enhances accountability within the platform, ensuring that all contributions are properly acknowledged and cannot be misattributed.

- Simplified Management: The NFT-based system simplifies the management of contributions and collaborations. Each contribution is uniquely identified and easily tracked, making it more efficient to allocate work and recognize efforts.

**Stuck Market**: A marketplace where contributors can view stucks, carry out effort, and receive any escrowed awards when the AI Auditor deams that the stuck has been solved.

**JIT Apps**: JIT (Just in Time) Apps are dynamically created applications deployed precisely when they are needed based on the content of the long thread, often in response to specific, immediate demands of a consumer. These apps are not pre-built or stored for later use; instead, they are created "just in time" from a library of available functions.
