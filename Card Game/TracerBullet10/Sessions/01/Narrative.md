Hi, I'll now give you the JSON data.  Read this data and DO NOT output anything other than "DONE" when you have read it all.  DO NOT give summaries or interim reports.

<cut and paste all.json>

List all customers whose last name begins with 'J'.  Give first and last names.

When is Alice's next pick up?  Give date.

Are there any customers who have the same first letter in their last name?  List first name and last name time there are more than one customer that fits that search.






I will now ask you some questions about which of the JSON scheme should be used for a particular scenario.  There may be more than one schema needed to satisfy the scenario.  If so you are to list then in order.  A schema can be used more than once.  Here's an example:

Question: Which customers are on route RP-04

1. routePlans: Find route RP-04 and list location IDs only.
2. locations: with the location IDs from step 1, list customerIDs only
3. customers: with the customer IDs from step 2, list customer first name and last names only.


{
  "example": {
    "Question": "Which customers are on route RP-04",
    "steps": [
      {
        "schema": "routePlans",
        "action": "Find route RP-04 and list location IDs only."
      },
      {
        "schema": "locations",
        "action": "With the location IDs from step 1, list customerIDs only."
      },
      {
        "schema": "customers",
        "action": "With the customer IDs from step 2, list customer first name and last names only."
      }
    ]
  }
}



Question: which customers have a pickup on weekends in January 2023?
{
  "Question": "Which customers have a pickup on weekends in January 2023?",
  "steps": [
    {
      "schema": "routePlans",
      "action": "Find routes scheduled for weekends in January 2023 and list location IDs only."
    },
    {
      "schema": "locations",
      "action": "With the location IDs from step 1, list customerIDs only."
    },
    {
      "schema": "customers",
      "action": "With the customer IDs from step 2, list customer first name and last names only."
    }
  ]
}

Questions: Across all customers, what is the average time for the routes they're subscribed to?

 {
  "Question": "Across all customers, what is the average time for the routes they're subscribed to?",
  "steps": [
    {
      "schema": "customers",
      "action": "List all customer IDs."
    },
    {
      "schema": "locations",
      "action": "For each customer ID, find corresponding location IDs."
    },
    {
      "schema": "routePlans",
      "action": "For each location ID found in step 2, find the estimated time for scheduled routes."
    },
    {
      "schema": "routePlans",
      "action": "Calculate the average estimated time for all routes."
    }
  ]
}

Question:  If Alice were to cancel her next pickup, what impact would that have on routes?

{
  "Question": "If Alice were to cancel her next pickup, what impact would that have on routes?",
  "steps": [
    {
      "schema": "customers",
      "action": "Find Alice's locationId using her customerId."
    },
    {
      "schema": "routePlans",
      "action": "Find routes that include Alice's locationId."
    },
    {
      "schema": "routePlans",
      "action": "For the routes found in step 2, list other impacted locations and times."
    }
  ]
}

Carry out the plan you've provided in response to the previous question.
