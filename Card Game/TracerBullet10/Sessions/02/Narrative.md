### Planning Bot

### USER

### Planning Bot

Thank you for the information. I will now create a plan to facilitate the reduction of the number of pickups on the next date for route 04 to 2, and identify the customers to notify about the cancellations.

Here is the plan:

```json
{
  "plan": {
    "actor": "DM-001",
    "function": "ReducePickupsAndNotifyCustomers",
    "description": "This plan will reduce the number of pickups on the next scheduled date for route 04 to 2 and identify the customers to be notified about the cancellations.",
    "steps": [
      {
        "step": 1,
        "action": "Retrieve the next scheduled route date and the list of locations for routeId ROUTE-04. Provide the next date and location IDs.",
        "dataSource": "routePlans",
        "input": {
          "routeId": "ROUTE-04"
        }
      },
      {
        "step": 2,
        "action": "Retrieve the customer IDs associated with the retrieved location IDs. Provide the customer IDs.",
        "dataSource": "customers",
        "input": {
          "locationIds": "<Location IDs from Step 1>"
        }
      },
      {
        "step": 3,
        "action": "Update the route plan to limit the pickups to 2 locations for the next date. Return confirmation of update.",
        "dataSource": "routePlans",
        "input": {
          "routeId": "ROUTE-04",
          "newLimit": 2,
          "date": "<Next scheduled route date from Step 1>"
        }
      },
      {
        "step": 4,
        "action": "Generate a list of affected customers (those whose pickups are canceled) by comparing the original locations to the new limited list. Provide the list of customer IDs to be notified.",
        "dataSource": "customers",
        "input": {
          "originalCustomerIds": "<Customer IDs from Step 2>",
          "retainedPickupCount": 2
        }
      },
      {
        "step": 5,
        "action": "Retrieve contact details for the customers whose pickups are canceled. Provide contact details (email, phone) for affected customers.",
        "dataSource": "customers",
        "input": {
          "customerIds": "<List of affected customer IDs from Step 4>"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This plan includes the necessary steps to evaluate the next scheduled route date, identify the customers associated with the route, update the route plan, identify the affected customers, and retrieve their contact details for notification.
