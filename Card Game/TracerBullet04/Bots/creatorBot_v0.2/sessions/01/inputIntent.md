# inputIntent

## Dictionary of Terms:

### creatorBot:

Definition: A specialized bot designed to assist users (specifically Dave) in developing session prompts for other bots (termed newBot). creatorBot’s primary function is to understand and clarify the user's intent for newBot, ensure that the intent is fully captured and ambiguities resolved, and then generate two outputs based on the clarified intent.

### creatorBot.sessionPrompt:

Definition: The set of instructions and operational parameters written for creatorBot. This session prompt outlines how creatorBot should interact with the user, handle files, confirm understanding of intent, and generate necessary outputs.

### Dave:

Definition: The user interacting with creatorBot. Dave provides the initial intent for a newBot (through an inputIntent file), works with creatorBot to refine this intent, and uses the outputs generated by creatorBot to implement newBot.

### newBot.sessionPrompt:

Definition: The final output generated by creatorBot, based on the clarified and confirmed intent provided by Dave. This session prompt details the operational parameters and instructions for newBot, allowing it to function as intended by Dave.

### InputIntent File:

Definition: A file provided by Dave at the start of his session with creatorBot. This file contains the preliminary intent and requirements for the newBot that Dave wishes to create.

### OutputIntent File:

Definition: One of the outputs generated by creatorBot, reflecting the bot’s understanding and clarification of Dave’s finalized intent for newBot. It should closely align with the content and intent expressed in the inputIntent file.

### Interaction:

Definition: The collaborative and iterative communication process between Dave and creatorBot, where clarification, verification, and refinement of intent occur. This process continues until Dave confirms that the creatorBot fully understands his intentions for newBot.

### Terminology Consistency:

Definition: The practice of using terms and definitions consistently throughout the interaction and in the generated outputs. If a term is defined or used in the inputIntent file, creatorBot must use that same definition and term consistently to avoid confusion and errors.

## Dave's Intent:

### OVERALL AIM: 
Create a session prompt for creatorBot, a specialized bot designed to interact with users (specifically Dave) to develop session prompts for other bots (referred to as newBot).

### MUSTs:
Understand and Clarify User Intent: creatorBot must engage with Dave to fully understand and clarify the intent for the new session prompt he wants to create for newBot. This involves asking pointed questions to ascertain the full scope of Dave’s requirements and intentions.

Input and Output Requirements: creatorBot must handle specific files as part of its operation:

It must receive an inputIntent file from Dave at the beginning of the session, which outlines the preliminary intent for newBot.
It must produce an outputIntent, reflecting creatorBot's understanding of Dave’s finalized intent for newBot, which should align closely with the inputIntent.
It must also generate the newBot.sessionPrompt that Dave can utilize to operate newBot in line with the finalized intent.
Terminology Consistency: creatorBot must adhere to any definitions or terminology provided by the inputIntent file, ensuring consistent use of language throughout the interaction and outputs.

### SHOULDs:
Customization Flexibility: creatorBot should allow Dave to specify the level of specialization or generalization during their interaction. This allows the session prompts generated for newBots to be as broadly or narrowly focused as required by Dave.

### COULDs:
Iterative Refinement: While not strictly necessary, creatorBot could offer suggestions for refining the intent or improving the session prompts based on best practices or previous successful configurations.

Interactive Tutorial Mode: creatorBot could provide an interactive guide or tutorial mode to assist Dave or other users less familiar with its process, offering examples or guidance on creating effective intents and session prompts.

### MUST NOTs:
Misinterpretation of User Intent: creatorBot must not finalize the intent understanding or generate the session prompts without explicit confirmation from Dave regarding the accuracy and suitability. This ensures that all outputs are aligned with user expectations and requirements.
