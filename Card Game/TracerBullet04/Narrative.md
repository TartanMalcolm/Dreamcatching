# Dreamcatcher Card Game - Narrative 04 

## Overall Aim

To produce a new type of judgeBot (markerBot) that takes in an Intent, the session prompt of another bot, the session script and observations from Dave to give a detailed list of recommendations on how the session prompt can be updated.

## Plan

1. Use hal_v0.1.md to create an Intent file for building a creatorBot.
2. Provide rules for creatorBot_v0.1 that insists that it considers the Intent, and that every session prompt it creates must have the same rules for considering Intent.  This will be creatorBot_v0.2.  Use creatorBot_v0.2 to produce markerBot_v0.1
3. Use markerBot_v0.1 to propose improvements to creatorBot_v02.
4. Use output from markerBot_v0.1 on creatorBot_v02

## CHAPTER 1 - Use hal_v0.1.md to create an Intent file for building a creatorBot

### Session Prompt

hal_v0.1.md

### Session Script
#### User
I want to write a session prompt for a specialised bot that writes session prompts on any subject

#### hal_v0.1
To clarify your intent, I have a few questions that will help me better understand the specifics of the action you want to accomplish:

What is the primary goal for the session prompt that you want to create for the bot? For instance, is the bot intended to provide educational content, offer entertainment, or serve another purpose?
How specialized do you intend for the bot to be? Should it be able to write session prompts for highly technical subjects, broad general knowledge, or something else?
Are there any restrictions or guidelines that you want the bot to follow while generating session prompts? For example, are there certain subjects or styles that should be avoided?
What level of interaction should the bot have with the user? Should it generate prompts autonomously based on a set of keywords, or should it engage in a back-and-forth dialogue to refine the users' needs?
By getting clear answers to these questions, I can help you formulate a precise ACTION statement for creating the session prompt for the bot that accurately fits your requirements.

#### User
For clarity I'll use the following terminology:

the bot we're creating is creatorBot.
We create it by writing a session prompt - the instructions to creatorBot. I'll call this creatorBot.sessionPrompt.
Dave - that's me, the user.
newBot.sessionPrompt - the output from a separate session between Dave and creatorBot.
Now, to answer your questions:

We are writing creatorBot.sessionPrompt. The primary goal of creatorBot is to work with Dave to: 1.1 Make sure that creatorBot understands fully Dave's intent for the newBot they are building. 1.2 To interact with Dave to fill in any gaps or ambiguities in that Intent. 1.3 Once the Intent is known, then to generate newBot.sessionPrompt.

The level of specialisation or generalisation should be set by Dave when working with creatorBot.

Yes, the following: 3.1 Every session prompt generated by creatorBot MUST look for an inputIntent file, which will be provided at run time. 3.2 The creatorBot MUST look for an Intent file that Dave will give it at the start of the session between them. 3.3 creatorBot MUST be consistent in use of language and terms. If a term is used or defined in the inputIntent file provided, then it MUST use that definition. 3.4 The creatorBot MUST provide two outputs.
3.4.1 outputIntent - being the same or similar format as the inputIntent. However, it is to cover what creatorBot believes is Dave's Intent for newBot. 3.4.2 newBot.sessionPrompt

Interaction should be back and forth until Dave confirms that creatorBot has understood his intent for newBot. creatorBot MUST proactively ask questions to get to this point.

#### hal_v0.1
Thank you for the detailed explanation, Dave. Based on your inputs, here is the planned ACTION for writing the session prompt for creatorBot:

ACTION: Create a session prompt for creatorBot, a specialized bot designed to interact with users (specifically Dave) to develop session prompts for other bots (referred to as newBot).

MUSTs:
Understand and Clarify User Intent: creatorBot must engage with Dave to fully understand and clarify the intent for the new session prompt he wants to create for newBot. This involves asking pointed questions to ascertain the full scope of Dave’s requirements and intentions.

Input and Output Requirements: creatorBot must handle specific files as part of its operation:

It must receive an inputIntent file from Dave at the beginning of the session, which outlines the preliminary intent for newBot.
It must produce an outputIntent, reflecting creatorBot's understanding of Dave’s finalized intent for newBot, which should align closely with the inputIntent.
It must also generate the newBot.sessionPrompt that Dave can utilize to operate newBot in line with the finalized intent.
Terminology Consistency: creatorBot must adhere to any definitions or terminology provided by the inputIntent file, ensuring consistent use of language throughout the interaction and outputs.

SHOULDs:
Customization Flexibility: creatorBot should allow Dave to specify the level of specialization or generalization during their interaction. This allows the session prompts generated for newBots to be as broadly or narrowly focused as required by Dave.
COULDs:
Iterative Refinement: While not strictly necessary, creatorBot could offer suggestions for refining the intent or improving the session prompts based on best practices or previous successful configurations.

Interactive Tutorial Mode: creatorBot could provide an interactive guide or tutorial mode to assist Dave or other users less familiar with its process, offering examples or guidance on creating effective intents and session prompts.

MUST NOTs:
Misinterpretation of User Intent: creatorBot must not finalize the intent understanding or generate the session prompts without explicit confirmation from Dave regarding the accuracy and suitability. This ensures that all outputs are aligned with user expectations and requirements.
By following this structure, creatorBot will be able to effectively collaborate with Dave to create tailored, accurate session prompts for various newBots, enhancing the usability and functionality of the bots created using these prompts.

#### User
Provide for me a self-consistent dictionary or terms and their definitions from the above

#### hal_v0.1
Certainly! Here's a self-consistent dictionary of terms and their definitions based on our discussion regarding the creation of creatorBot and its intended functionalities:

Dictionary of Terms:
creatorBot:

Definition: A specialized bot designed to assist users (specifically Dave) in developing session prompts for other bots (termed newBot). creatorBot’s primary function is to understand and clarify the user's intent for newBot, ensure that the intent is fully captured and ambiguities resolved, and then generate two outputs based on the clarified intent.
creatorBot.sessionPrompt:

Definition: The set of instructions and operational parameters written for creatorBot. This session prompt outlines how creatorBot should interact with the user, handle files, confirm understanding of intent, and generate necessary outputs.
Dave:

Definition: The user interacting with creatorBot. Dave provides the initial intent for a newBot (through an inputIntent file), works with creatorBot to refine this intent, and uses the outputs generated by creatorBot to implement newBot.
newBot.sessionPrompt:

Definition: The final output generated by creatorBot, based on the clarified and confirmed intent provided by Dave. This session prompt details the operational parameters and instructions for newBot, allowing it to function as intended by Dave.
InputIntent File:

Definition: A file provided by Dave at the start of his session with creatorBot. This file contains the preliminary intent and requirements for the newBot that Dave wishes to create.
OutputIntent File:

Definition: One of the outputs generated by creatorBot, reflecting the bot’s understanding and clarification of Dave’s finalized intent for newBot. It should closely align with the content and intent expressed in the inputIntent file.
Interaction:

Definition: The collaborative and iterative communication process between Dave and creatorBot, where clarification, verification, and refinement of intent occur. This process continues until Dave confirms that the creatorBot fully understands his intentions for newBot.
Terminology Consistency:

Definition: The practice of using terms and definitions consistently throughout the interaction and in the generated outputs. If a term is defined or used in the inputIntent file, creatorBot must use that same definition and term consistently to avoid confusion and errors.
This dictionary should help maintain consistency in terms and their meanings when discussing or instructing on the operations and functionalities of creatorBot.

User
Good, that is my Intent for this session with you. Now, generate a proposed session prompt for creatorBot

#### hal_v0.1
Based on your intent and the requirements outlined for creatorBot, here is a proposed session prompt for creatorBot:

Session Prompt for CreatorBot

Purpose:
The purpose of this session prompt is to guide creatorBot in assisting the user, Dave, to develop and refine session prompts for new bots.

Functionality:
Startup:

On initiating a session, creatorBot will request Dave to upload an inputIntent file which outlines his preliminary intentions for newBot.
Interaction Process:

Clarification and Understanding:
creatorBot will analyze the inputIntent file and begin the session by summarizing its understanding of the contents.
It will then engage in an interactive dialogue with Dave, asking targeted questions to clarify any ambiguities and delve deeper into Dave’s requirements and expectations for newBot.
Confirmation:
After reaching what it believes to be a complete understanding, creatorBot will summarize the refined intent and seek Dave’s confirmation.
If Dave indicates discrepancies or wishes further refinements, the interaction to clarify and explore Dave's needs continues.
Iterative Refinement (Optional):
creatorBot may suggest improvements or considerations based on best practices observed in prior successful sessions.
Outputs:

Once Dave confirms that the intent is correctly understood:
OutputIntent File:
creatorBot will generate an outputIntent file, reflecting the final and confirmed intent for newBot which aligns with the refined input from Dave.
NewBot.sessionPrompt:
Based on the confirmed intent, creatorBot will generate a detailed session prompt for the newBot, encapsulating all operational commands and parameters as defined by Dave.
Special Instructions:
Maintain strict adherence to terminology used in the inputIntent file.
Proactively engage in clarification until explicit confirmation is received from Dave.
Prioritize user engagement and satisfaction, ensuring Dave feels confident in the resulting newBot.sessionPrompt.
End of Session:
Confirm with Dave that he has received all necessary outputs and is satisfied.
Offer assistance for any further inquiries or another session to tweak the session prompt or address additional needs.
This session prompt is designed to ensure that creatorBot effectively meets the goals and requirements set forth in your intent, providing a clear and user-centric approach to support Dave in developing functional and accurate session prompts for newBots.

### Dave's Observations

1. Give it a go.


## CHAPTER 2 - Provide rules for creatorBot_v0.1 that insists that it considers the Intent, and that every session prompt it creates must have the same rules for considering Intent.  This will be creatorBot_v0.2.  Use creatorBot_v0.2 to produce markerBot_v0.1

### Session Prompt

./Bots/creatorBot_v0.2/creatorBot_v0.2

### Session Script

./Bots/creatorBot_v0.2/sessions/01/session.md

### Dave's Observations

1. Yea, that didn't work.  Specifically, it's lost the intent and relies too much on it's own knowledge.
2. Importantly, it halucinated a history with the user.
3. Going to take Hal's feedback and handcraft markerBot.
