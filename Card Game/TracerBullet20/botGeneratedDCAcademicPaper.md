**4. Interaction Dynamics Among Entities**

This section provides a detailed exploration of the interactions among the different entities within the Dreamcatcher ecosystem:

1. **Contributors** create **Contributions** that enhance specific **Innovations**. The relationship is characterized as:
   - **CONTRIBUTOR** "makes" **CONTRIBUTION**: This signifies that contributions originate from contributors. For example, an independent researcher may produce a paper detailing the results of a study that can significantly impact the development of a new product. Alex Thompson, a contributor, might document a new feature in software that he has coded, enhancing functionality.

2. **Contributions** are linked to **Innovations**:
   - **INNOVATION** "is enhanced by" **CONTRIBUTION**: This indicates that contributions are integral to the evolution of innovations. As an illustration, a team of engineers may submit various technical designs that collectively contribute to a new software platform’s architecture. Each design submission is reflected in the progress of the innovation project.

3. **Work Products** are outputs of collaborative efforts driven by contributors:
   - **CONTRIBUTOR** "creates" **WORK_PRODUCT**: This interaction emphasizes that contributors take direct actions to form work products. A graphic designer, for example, might produce a series of graphics intended to accompany a marketing campaign for an innovation. This work product is then made available for review to both consumers and other contributors for feedback.

4. **Consumers** benefit from and utilize **Innovations**:
   - **CONSUMER** "uses" **INNOVATION**: This relationship highlights the end-user perspective. For instance, businesses might employ an innovative project management tool developed within the Dreamcatcher framework to streamline their operations. Jamie Lee, a project manager, uses the tool to organize tasks and monitor team performance.

5. **Feedback Loops**: 
   - Consumers can provide feedback on innovations, which directly influences contributions and further enhancements. For example, Jamie might note that a feature is useful but could benefit from a user-friendly redesign. This feedback then feeds back into the contributions, enhancing future iterations.

**5. Permission and Governance Model**

Dreamcatcher operates under a clearly defined permission model aimed at balancing autonomy and oversight. Table 2 outlines the permission categories delineating what actions each type of actor can perform, ensuring effective governance.

| Actor        | Permissions |
|--------------|-------------|
| Contributor  | Create, modify, enhance Contributions. |
| Consumer     | View Innovations only. |
| Pre-buyer    | Invest in projects via Escrow without altering the Innovation process. |
| Platform Admin| Oversee and manage the entire system, including entities and permissions. |

Table 2: Permission Model

By establishing clear permissions, the platform ensures that each participant can engage meaningfully while adhering to a structured set of guidelines. For instance, while Contributors have the freedom to innovate and promote their ideas, Consumers are distinctly positioned to provide feedback on innovations without modifying them, which maintains the integrity of the collaborative process.
