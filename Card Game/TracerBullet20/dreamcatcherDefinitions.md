# DREAMCATCHER

## Definitions

**Contribution**: Any input, effort, or service provided by an individual or entity that directly or indirectly impacts the development, creation, or improvement of a system, product, or process. Contributions are recorded through the mechanism of state change. Contributions include coding, project management, mentoring, investing resources, or providing support services. Each contribution is recognized as adding value to the overall project and is recorded through state changes. Contributions are a key factor in determining attribution, which is the process of assigning value or credit to the various contributors based on the impact of their efforts on the final outcome.

**Contributor**: An individual or entity that provides effort, resources, or services to a project or system, leading to a state change or improvement. Contributors are the only role that can create, modify, or enhance the innovation. Contributors play a direct role in the creation, modification, or enhancement of the product or process. Their contributions include activities specified in Contribution, such as coding, project management, mentoring, or any tasks that result in a tangible or intangible output. Contributors are distinct from pre-buyers or consumers, as they are actively involved in the development process, and their contributions are essential for the project's progress and success. The value and impact of a contributor's work are evaluated to determine their share in the attribution and reward system.

**State Change**: Any modification performed by a contributor on an innovation that alters its current state, including the addition of new features, bug fixes, raising issues, or updating existing functionalities. State changes are meaningful events used to calculate attributions, impacts, or other relevant metrics.

**Consumer**: An entity (which could be an individual, organization, or system) that utilizes or benefits from a product, service, or outcome generated by the contributions and investments within the system. Unlike a pre-buyer or contributor, a consumer does not directly participate in the creation or funding of the product but derives value from its use. The consumer's interaction with the product generates impact, which is then used to calculate the value or attribution of that product to the various contributors and pre-buyers involved in its creation. The consumer's behavior and the resulting impact are crucial for determining how resources and credits are dispersed among those who contributed to or invested in the product.

**Innovation**: The collective term for any product, service, process, or system that is being or has been created, modified, or enhanced by contributors. Innovations are the central focus for contributions and state changes, serving as the objects that contributors work on to bring significant value.

**Services**: Actions, tasks, or support provided by contributors that facilitate the development, maintenance, or improvement of a product. These services include mentoring, consulting, project management, technical support, and any other roles that contribute indirectly to the creation of tangible outputs. While services may not result in direct outputs like code or documentation, they are essential for enabling and enhancing the overall productivity and effectiveness of the project. Services are considered a form of contribution and are factored into the attribution and valuation process, recognizing the importance of these roles in the successful delivery of the final product or outcome.

**Actor**: Any individual, entity, or system that plays a role in the processes within Dreamcatcher. This includes contributors, pre-buyers, and consumers. Each actor's actions are considered in the attribution process to determine their share of value or credit within the system.

**Pre-buyer**: An individual or entity that makes an advanced purchase or stakes value to support the development, creation, or enhancement of a system, product, or process. Pre-buyers contribute funds to an escrow and are distinct from contributors who directly engage in producing outputs or services. The role of the pre-buyer is to enable and facilitate the project's progress by supplying the necessary resources without the risk of losing their capital if the deliverable does not arrive.

**Stuck**: A situation or problem that has halted progress within a project or process. When someone encounters a stuck, they are unable to move forward due to an unresolved issue. When an actor creates a stuck, the issue is made public and other actors are invited to address or solve it. Stucks may be backed by escrowed funds from pre-buyers to incentivize solving the issue.

**Impact**: The measurable effect or influence that a contribution, investment by a pre-buyer, or consumption by a consumer has in the real world. Impact is a key factor in determining the value and attribution of efforts within the system. Impact is used to calculate how resources, rewards, or credits should be distributed among the different actors—contributors, pre-buyers, and consumers.

**Impact Crystal**: A model used to represent the multi-dimensional impact of contributions by contributors, investments by pre-buyers, and consumption by consumers within the system. Impact Crystals represent an arbitrary list of dimensions, such as financial value, social influence, environmental benefits, or technological advancement. Impact Crystals are calculated at an event by first normalizing the ratio within each dimension, comparing like-by-like, then proposing a ratio between dimensions. In this way, any dispersal event (e.g., a cash payment) can be distributed fairly and transparently. Impact Crystals acknowledge that impact is complex and multi-faceted and provide a structured way to assess and attribute value in a fair and transparent manner.

**Dispersal Event**: The process where the accumulated value, resources, or rewards within the system are distributed among the various actors—contributors, pre-buyers, and possibly consumers—based on the impact they have generated. This event occurs after an impact has been measured and analyzed through an Impact Crystal.

**Platform Admin**: Platform Admin are individuals or entities responsible for overseeing, maintaining, and managing the technical and operational aspects of Dreamcatcher. Their role includes ensuring the platform runs smoothly, implementing necessary updates or changes, and addressing any issues that arise within the system. Currently, Platform Admin has the authority to make decisions about the platform's functionality, security, and overall governance. In the future, this may be devolved to the community.

**Artifact**: The underlying operating system which contributors, pre-buyers, and consumers use to provide compute facilities, storage, file manipulation, and workflows within Dreamcatcher.

**Business Rules**: A set of guidelines or criteria followed by all actors that dictate the functioning and decision-making processes within Dreamcatcher and apps running on Artifact.

**Event**: Any significant action, occurrence, or change within Dreamcatcher triggered by any actor that leads to a state change. Events include a wide range of activities, such as a commit, the completion of a task, the alteration of Artifact, or a dispersal event.

**Ambient Attribution**: A process designed to automatically capture, track, and record contributions made by users in real-time, leveraging blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each contribution is tokenized as an NFT, serving as a unique and verifiable digital asset that represents the contributor's work. NFTs are tradable and act as dimensions in an Impact Crystal. This system ensures that recognition and rewards are based on the tangible impact of contributions rather than the time invested.

**Stuck Market**: A marketplace where contributors can view stucks, carry out effort, and receive any escrowed awards when the AI Auditor deems that the stuck has been solved.

**Escrow**: A financial arrangement where funds are held as a prize that can be called upon completion of certain terms. Upon satisfying the escrow conditions, ownership and control over the escrowed funds or assets are transferred to the rightful actor. This mechanism ensures that contributors or pre-buyers have a stake in the successful completion of a task or project.

**JIT Apps**: JIT (Just in Time) Apps are dynamically created applications deployed precisely when they are needed based on the needs of the consumer at the time of use. These apps are not pre-built or stored for later use; instead, they are created "just in time" from a library of available functions.

**Attribution**: The assignation of value or credit to various contributors based on the impact of their efforts on the final outcome. Attribution involves evaluating contributions in terms of their significance, relevance, and impact on the project to determine the fair allocation of recognition and rewards. It integrates metrics such as state changes, impact measures, and the value created to ensure contributors receive appropriate acknowledgment for their efforts.

**Reward**: The compensation or recognition provided to contributors for their efforts and contributions to a project or system. Rewards take various forms, including financial compensation, tokens of recognition, and other benefits. The reward system is based on the measured impact and attribution of contributions, ensuring fair and equitable distribution among all actors involved.

**Prior Art**: Previously created intellectual property or innovations contributed or used by contributors that can be used as reference points or building blocks for new development. Prior art includes existing technologies, processes, designs, patents, and other documented knowledge that can be drawn upon to inform and support the creation or improvement of new innovations. In Dreamcatcher, contributing prior art involves surrendering some ownership rights upon completion of the terms of escrow.

**Karma**: A conceptual metric used to reflect a contributor's, pre-buyer's, or consumer's historical behavior and engagement within the Dreamcatcher system. Karma is influenced by various factors such as the consistency of contributions, adherence to fair practices, and the degree of collaboration with other actors. Positive karma can enhance an actor's reputation and influence within the platform, while negative karma can result from actions that undermine the community's values. Karma is considered when determining attribution and dispersal of rewards.

**ATTRIBUTION_GPT**: An AI system responsible for evaluating and assigning attributions to contributions based on their impact. ATTRIBUTION_GPT ensures that contributors receive fair acknowledgment and rewards according to the significance and relevance of their work. This entity plays a crucial role in maintaining transparency and fairness within the Dreamcatcher system.

**IMPACT_GPT**: An AI system tasked with measuring and calculating the impact of contributions and state changes. It quantifies the real-world effects of efforts using predefined dimensions, aiding in the process of fair attribution. IMPACT_GPT ensures that the contributions' influence on the innovations is accurately recognized and valued.

**PRICE_GPT**: An AI system dedicated to assessing and determining fair pricing for contributions and innovations. PRICE_GPT takes into account historical pricing data, the significance of contributions, and market conditions to advise on optimal pricing strategies. It helps maintain transparency and fairness in financial matters within the Dreamcatcher system.
