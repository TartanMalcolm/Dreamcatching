I need a bot team to assess three inputs against a marking scheme.  I can give a first guess about the marking scheme but it's probably wrong.  So I'll also need you to refine that when I tell you about the topic.
ChatGPT
Got it. Let's start with the topic and your initial thoughts on the marking scheme. Once I understand the context and what you're assessing, I can help refine the marking scheme and suggest how a bot team could evaluate the inputs accordingly. Please share the details.

So the goal is to get an article written on a subject, and to make sure it's of high enough quality that it can be published in the wall street journal
ChatGPT
To ensure an article meets the quality standards for publication in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), we need to consider several critical factors. Your initial marking scheme can be refined based on the following criteria, which are crucial for a piece to be considered of high enough quality for such a reputable publication:

Relevance and Timeliness: The topic should be of current interest to the WSJ's readership, which includes business professionals, investors, and the informed public. It should provide fresh insights or information not widely discussed.

Accuracy and Depth of Research: The article must be factually accurate, with all claims backed by reliable sources. It should display a deep understanding of the subject matter, including context and nuances, demonstrating thorough research.

Clarity and Coherence: The writing should be clear, accessible, and logically structured, making complex topics understandable without oversimplification. It should flow smoothly, with each section building upon the previous to support the article’s main thesis.

Originality and Insight: The article should offer unique perspectives or analysis, not merely rehashing common knowledge. It should provide value by illuminating the topic in a new or different light.

Style and Tone: The tone should align with the WSJ's, which is informative yet engaging, professional but accessible. The writing style should maintain a balance between being authoritative and approachable, using technical terms where necessary but explained clearly.

Adherence to Journalistic Standards: This includes ethical reporting, impartiality (where applicable), and a clear distinction between reporting and opinion (if the piece is not an op-ed). The article should meet the WSJ’s editorial guidelines.

SEO and Digital Optimization: While this might not directly impact editorial quality, ensuring the article is optimized for search engines without compromising its integrity or readability can be a plus point, especially for online publications.

A bot team assessing articles against these criteria would need to evaluate not just the presence of these elements but their quality. For example, assessing depth of research might involve checking the diversity and credibility of sources cited. Evaluating clarity could involve analyzing sentence structure and vocabulary for accessibility. Originality checks might compare the article against existing published works for similarity.

To refine this marking scheme further or adapt it into an actionable plan for a bot team, consider which aspects can be effectively assessed using automated tools (e.g., plagiarism checks, readability scores) and which might require human judgment (e.g., depth of insight, coherence of arguments). Integrating both automated assessments with expert reviews could be a strategy to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

If there are specific areas within these criteria you want to focus on or have questions about implementing this scheme, please let me know!

OK, I agree, but not all of those are of equal value.  What does the WSL journal value?  I'm looking at marking a text to make sure it reaches their criterion, not mine.
ChatGPT
For content aimed at the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), understanding the publication's editorial priorities is key to ensuring your article meets their criteria. While the WSJ values all the elements previously mentioned, their weighting might vary depending on the nature of the article (e.g., news, opinion, analysis). However, focusing on the core values and priorities of the WSJ can help prioritize and refine your marking scheme:

Accuracy and Integrity: The WSJ places a premium on factual accuracy and in-depth reporting. Articles must be thoroughly researched, with claims supported by credible sources. The integrity of the information presented is paramount, as the WSJ's reputation is built on reliability and trust.

Relevance to Business and Financial Readers: While the WSJ covers a broad range of topics, it is foremost a business and financial newspaper. Articles that provide insights, analysis, or information relevant to business professionals, investors, and policy-makers are highly valued. This includes trends in major industries, financial markets, economic analysis, and corporate governance.

Timeliness and Newsworthiness: The WSJ seeks to inform its readers about current developments that affect the business world, financial markets, and the economy. Articles that address or predict timely issues, provide fresh insights into ongoing stories, or uncover new information are particularly valued.

Clear, Concise, and Engaging Writing: The ability to distill complex topics into clear, accessible prose without sacrificing depth or nuance is highly prized. The WSJ values writing that engages readers, encouraging them to think critically about the topic at hand.

Originality and Insight: The WSJ appreciates articles that offer new perspectives or insights into a topic. This could involve innovative analysis, connecting seemingly disparate facts to reveal a bigger picture, or providing thought leadership on emerging trends.

Global Perspective: Given the WSJ's international readership, articles that provide a global perspective or analyze how international developments affect business and finance are particularly valuable. This includes understanding the implications of geopolitical events, global economic trends, and international trade policies.

Based on these priorities, you might consider designing a marking scheme that particularly emphasizes these areas, assigning higher weights to criteria like accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and insight. For example, a scoring system could be developed where points are allocated more heavily towards these elements. Additionally, incorporating a review process that involves both automated tools (for factual accuracy, plagiarism, etc.) and human judgment (for evaluating relevance, insight, and writing quality) can help ensure that articles meet the WSJ's standards.

This is an opinion piece.  How would you weight what they care about?  The topic piece is around tech/AI.
ChatGPT
For an opinion piece on technology/AI intended for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the weighting shifts slightly to prioritize insight, originality, relevance to their readership, and how the piece engages with current debates or developments in the tech/AI field. Here's how you might weight the criteria based on the WSJ's editorial priorities for such an article:

Originality and Insight (25%): Given the vast amount of commentary already available on technology and AI, the WSJ would highly value unique perspectives or insights that offer readers new ways of thinking about the subject. This includes innovative analysis, predictions about the future impact of technology, ethical considerations, or connections to broader economic, social, or political issues.

Relevance to Business and Financial Readers (20%): The article should connect the implications of technology/AI developments to business, finance, and economic trends. How might advancements in AI affect different industries, labor markets, investment strategies, or global trade? This connection to the interests of the WSJ's core readership is crucial.

Engagement with Current Debates or Developments (20%): Opinions that engage directly with recent news, legislation, ethical debates, or industry trends in technology and AI will be more valuable. This timeliness makes the piece more compelling and relevant to readers who want to stay informed about current discussions.

Quality of Argumentation (15%): The strength and coherence of the argument presented are critical, especially for an opinion piece. This includes clear reasoning, effective use of evidence, and anticipation of counterarguments. The WSJ values well-argued positions that contribute constructively to the debate.

Writing Quality (10%): While always important, for an opinion piece, the way an argument is communicated can be as crucial as the argument itself. The WSJ looks for clear, engaging, and accessible writing that can convey complex ideas effectively to a broad audience.

Ethical Considerations and Responsibility (10%): Articles discussing technology and AI should demonstrate awareness of ethical considerations, potential societal impacts, and the responsibilities of technologists and businesses. Highlighting these aspects can distinguish the piece in a field often criticized for overlooking such concerns.

When marking the text, consider using a rubric that assigns scores to these categories according to their weight. For instance, originality and insight might be evaluated on a scale where the highest score reflects a genuinely novel perspective or analysis not widely discussed. Similarly, relevance could be assessed based on the directness and clarity with which the article links technology/AI developments to broader business or economic issues.

This approach allows for a nuanced assessment that aligns with the WSJ's editorial standards for opinion pieces, particularly those focusing on the dynamic and influential fields of technology and AI.

User
OK, so here's the header and subheader structure.  I'm happy with that.  Remember that I'm trying to get a bot team together to do this for me.  So what I want is to be able to say whether an edit in the piece, as it goes through the writing process, improves the article of not, and give it some kind of score.  How do I do that?
ChatGPT
Setting up a bot team to evaluate and score edits during the writing process for an opinion piece on tech/AI, aiming for publication standards like those of the Wall Street Journal, requires a structured approach. This process involves creating a scoring system based on the editorial criteria previously discussed, and then implementing a way to measure the impact of edits against these criteria. Here's how you can approach it:

1. Define Evaluation Criteria and Scoring System
First, clearly define the evaluation criteria based on the priorities: Originality and Insight, Relevance, Engagement with Current Debates, Quality of Argumentation, Writing Quality, and Ethical Considerations. Assign each criterion a weight reflecting its importance.

Create a scoring system for each criterion on a scale (e.g., 1-10), where each point represents specific aspects or qualities that edits could introduce or improve in the article.

2. Implement Automated and Semi-Automated Assessment Tools
Originality and Insight: Use text similarity tools to compare the article against a database of existing content to ensure the edit brings new perspectives. A decrease in similarity scores could indicate increased originality.
Relevance and Engagement: Implement keyword analysis to identify and score the presence and addition of relevant terms tied to current debates, industry terms, and business implications.
Quality of Argumentation: Develop or use existing natural language processing (NLP) tools to evaluate logical structure, argument strength, and counterargument handling. Increases in logical flow and argumentative coherence could be quantitatively scored.
Writing Quality: Use readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) to assess and score writing clarity and engagement. Improvements in readability metrics after an edit could reflect higher scores.
Ethical Considerations: Keyword and sentiment analysis tools can identify and assess the depth of ethical considerations. Edits that increase mentions and balanced discussion of ethical concerns score higher.
3. Score Edits Based on Impact
For each edit, the system should evaluate how the changes affect each criterion. For example, if an edit introduces a novel analysis not commonly discussed, it would increase the score under Originality and Insight. If an edit makes the argument more coherent or introduces relevant data, it boosts the Quality of Argumentation score.

4. Aggregate and Normalize Scores
Aggregate the scores from each criterion for an edit, weighting them according to their importance. Normalize these scores to a common scale (e.g., 0-100) to provide a unified score for each edit. This unified score reflects the overall improvement or decline in the article's quality per the WSJ's standards.

5. Continuous Learning and Calibration
For a bot to accurately assess improvements, it must learn from feedback. Incorporate a mechanism where human reviewers can input whether they agree or disagree with the bot's assessment. Use this feedback to continuously train and refine the bot's evaluation algorithms.

Implementation Notes
Combining Tools: Most of these assessments require a combination of custom scripts and existing tools. For example, readability and text similarity can be checked with available software, while assessing argumentation quality might need a custom approach based on NLP.
Human Oversight: Despite automation, maintain a level of human oversight to ensure the bot's assessments align with editorial standards and to provide qualitative feedback that might be beyond the bot's current capabilities.
This setup requires a thoughtful blend of technology and editorial judgment, leveraging the strengths of automated systems for objective, quantifiable changes while recognizing the nuances that human reviewers bring to subjective criteria like originality and insightfulness.
